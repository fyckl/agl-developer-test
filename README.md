# Cat sorter

Sorting cats alphabetically into two lists depending on the gender of their owner.

## Assumptions

1. Some owner may not have pets
2. Some owners may have many pets and not just cats

## Solution formulation

Steps I thought of and executed for sorting out the cats for the given data:

    1. Work out if owner was a certain gender and has pets
    2. If they have pets, sort out which are cats
    3. Then create an array with those cats
    4. Sort out the two arrays alphabetically
